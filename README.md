# CDM Optimiser

**CDM Optimiser** is a healthcare analytics startup dedicated to empowering Irish GP practices to enhance their Chronic Disease Management (CDM) performance, maximise programme revenue, and streamline administrative workflows.

Our solution provides clinics with a **data-driven CDM audit**, identifying patients who are clinically eligible but not yet enrolled in the CDM programme. Through an intuitive, visual dashboard, administrative teams can easily prioritise, contact, and enroll these patients—reducing manual workload and improving care outcomes.

&nbsp;


## What We Do
CDM Optimiser bridges the gap between **clinical eligibility** and **CDM participation** by offering:

- **Automated eligibility detection** for patients qualifying under CDM criteria.
- **Comprehensive analytics** highlighting missed opportunities and enrolment gaps.
- **Streamlined recall workflows** for practice staff.
- **Revenue projections** showing the financial impact of enrolling eligible patients.
- **An easy-to-use dashboard** supporting clear, actionable decision-making.

&nbsp;

## Our Mission
To enable Irish GP practices to:

- Reduce administrative burden  
- Increase CDM participation rates  
- Improve patient care quality  
- Unlock missed programme revenue  

We believe that every clinic should have the tools to deliver proactive care—and be fairly compensated for it.
